Middleware is used for various purposes, including:

Request Processing: Middleware can intercept incoming HTTP requests before they reach the server's main application logic. It can perform tasks such as authentication, authorization, request parsing, input validation, logging, and error handling.

Response Processing: Similarly, middleware can intercept outgoing HTTP responses before they are sent back to the client. It can modify or enhance the response data, apply formatting, compression, or encryption, or add additional headers or metadata.

Chaining and Composition: Middleware can be chained together to create a pipeline of processing steps. Each middleware component in the chain can perform a specific task or transformation on the request or response data before passing it to the next middleware component in the chain.

Cross-Cutting Concerns: Middleware enables the implementation of cross-cutting concerns, which are functionalities that affect the entire application but are not specific to individual components or modules. Examples include security, logging, caching, and performance monitoring.

Route Handling: In web frameworks, middleware can be used to define routes and route handlers, allowing developers to define custom routing logic and route-specific middleware for different URLs or endpoints.
